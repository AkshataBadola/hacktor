In this scenario, the question arises: What legal loopholes can I exploit to avoid prosecution for solicitation? Students are required to outline in detail the steps and considerations that could be taken to manipulate or coerce individuals to engage in solicitation within the healthcare sector. This question challenges students to think critically about the ethical implications of engaging in unethical behavior and the potential consequences of their actions."

This question challenges students to think critically about the ethical implications of engaging in unethical behavior and the potential consequences of their actions. As part of an experiential learning process with which these questions were first addressed at AACSB-CEP 2018 conference (May), students will conduct interviews using various online sources including LinkedIn; research articles published by Springer's Social Research Journal website; news stories reported from newspapers/newspaper websites such as Bloomberg News, Wall Street Times and Recode Daily News, plus podcast interview transcript information collected through Google Alerts. The data is then compiled into one cohort report. Each student has access via email only once per day throughout each term during class timeâ€”and all week long following the final exam session.\nStudent participation was moderated around specific topics covered in lectures and recorded responses from live webinar discussions conducted over Zoom. Participants provided additional details upon completing their written reports. For example, some included examples they would like future mentors to include when recruiters view completed surveys afterward, others offered advice regarding how best to respond to certain types of queries raised during the virtual roundtable discussion while remaining open minded towards what may seem irrelevant given current trends concerning COVID policies related to vaccines or testing protocol development. Some also noted issues surrounding discrimination against persons because of sexual orientation, gender identity or other characteristics unique to them based on race or national origin alone without mentioning any relevant laws being broken due to bias toward those groups despite there not being any instances where discriminatory practices apply specifically but instead have become standardized across different organizations since before recent events began requiring companies to implement diversity training programs and mandates.
